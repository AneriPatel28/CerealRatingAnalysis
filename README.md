# Cereal Rating Analysis

## Overview

This repository houses the "DV Project" Jupyter notebook which explores the relationship between various nutritional factors of cereals and their consumer ratings. The analysis specifically aims to determine which manufacturers receive the highest ratings and how different nutritional values impact these ratings.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes the `cereal.csv` dataset, originally sourced from Kaggle. This dataset comprises detailed nutritional information along with ratings for various cereals. The key attributes included in the dataset are:

- **Manufacturer**: The company producing the cereal.
- **Calories**: Energy content per serving.
- **Protein**: Grams of protein per serving.
- **Fat**: Grams of fat per serving.
- **Fiber**: Grams of dietary fiber per serving.
- **Carbohydrates**: Grams of carbohydrates per serving.
- **Sugar**: Grams of sugar per serving.
- **Sodium**: Milligrams of sodium per serving.
- **Potassium**: Milligrams of potassium per serving.
- **Vitamins**: Percentage of vitamins per serving.
- **Shelf**: Shelf placement in the store (1, 2, or 3).
- **Weight**: Weight of one serving.
- **Cups**: Recommended number of cups per serving.
- **Rating**: Consumer rating of the cereal.

## Analysis Objectives

The notebook aims to provide insights into:
1. Which manufacturers receive the highest consumer ratings.
2. The impact of nutritional factors like calories, fat, fiber, and sugar on cereal ratings.
3. Trends and patterns that can help manufacturers improve their products.
